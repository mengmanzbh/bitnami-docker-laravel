# Bitnami Laravel Development Container

## TL;DR;

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* Bitnami images are built on CircleCI and automatically pushed to the Docker Hub.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.

## Introduction

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a web application framework for [PHP](https://php.net), released as free and open-source software under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The Bitnami Laravel Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Laravel development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Laravel Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Laravel Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Laravel application:

```bash
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-laravel/master/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```bash
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-laravel/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Finally launch the Laravel application development environment using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Among other things, the above command creates a container service, named `myapp`, for Laravel development and bootstraps a new Laravel application in the application directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

> **Note**
>
> If the application directory contained the source code of an existing Laravel application, the Bitnami Laravel Development Container would load the existing application instead of bootstrapping a new one.

After the artisan application server has been launched in the `myapp` service, visit http://localhost:3000 in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the default Laravel welcome page.

In addition to the Laravel Development Container, the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-laravel/master/docker-compose.yml) file also configures a MariaDB service to serve as the database backend of your Laravel application.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Laravel Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```

, where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples of launching some commonly used Laravel development commands inside the `myapp` service container.

- List all `artisan` commands:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp php artisan list
  ```

- List all registered routes:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp php artisan route:list
  ```

- Create a new application controller named `User`:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose exec myapp composer require phpmailer/phpmailer:5.2.*
  ```
